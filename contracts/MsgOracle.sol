@dev This on-chain msgOracle must be queried by a swarm-node. By reading the event logs, a node is able to construct the following object:
msgPrices: {TTL, prices: {swarmMsgX: [<validFrom0, price>, <validFromN, price>], swarmMsgX: [<validFrom0, price>, <validFromN, price>]}}.
this object expires after TTL seconds. The prices object holds all message types with their respective price arrays.
In the price array of a message, multiple prices can be quoted. The chosen price is the most-recent price.
